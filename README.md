"Spam-classifier" 
It is text based spam-classifier.<br>
Dataset is taken from kaggle "email spam".<br>
There are two models for classification. User can compare the results. <br>
<p> 1. Multinomial Naive-bayes.<br>
2. Hugging Face Transformer.
</p>
<br>
As expected Transformer performs better, but naive bayes model is also good as it is lightweight.
